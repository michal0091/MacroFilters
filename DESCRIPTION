Description: Implements the Hybrid MacroBoost (MBH) protocol for decomposing 
    macroeconomic time series into trend and cycle components. Unlike the standard 
    Hodrick-Prescott filter, 'MacroFilters' utilizes component-wise L2-boosting 
    with robust loss functions (Huber) to handle extreme transient shocks 
    (e.g., COVID-19) without inducing spurious trend shifts. The algorithm 
    includes an automated two-layer diagnostic stage for unit roots and structural 
    breaks, optimized via corrected AICc for computational efficiency.
